# infinitySky

## Overview

**infinitySky** is a 2D arcade game developed in Go. In this game, the player controls a spaceship that must navigate through a field of asteroids. The goal is to break as many asteroids as possible without colliding with them. A collision results in the player's loss.

## Gameplay

- **Controls**: The player moves the spaceship using keyboard controls (e.g., arrow keys or WASD) and fires at asteroids using a specific key (e.g., spacebar).
- **Objective**: Break as many asteroids as possible to achieve a high score.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the spaceship collides with an asteroid.

## Features

- **Spaceship Movement**: The spaceship can move in all directions within the game window.
- **Asteroid Interaction**: Asteroids appear randomly and can be destroyed by shooting them.
- **Collision Detection**: The game detects collisions between the spaceship and asteroids, triggering a game over when they occur.
- **Score Tracking**: The game tracks the player's score based on the number of asteroids destroyed.
